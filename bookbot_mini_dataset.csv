In 1942, with the Nazis occupying Holland, a thirteen-year-old Jewish girl and her family fled their home in Amsterdam and went into hiding. For the next two years, until their whereabouts were betrayed to the Gestapo, the Franks and another family lived cloistered in the “Secret Annexe” of an old office building.

The Catcher in the Rye,J.D. Salinger,"It's Christmas time and Holden Caulfield has just been expelled from yet another school...Fleeing the crooks at Pencey Prep, he pinballs around New York City seeking solace in fleeting encounters—shooting the bull with strangers in dive hotels, wandering alone round Central Park, getting beaten up by pimps and cut down by erstwhile girlfriends.

“I got you to look after me, and you got me to look after you, and that'swhy.”
They are an unlikely pair: George is ""small and quick and dark of face""; Lennie, a man of tremendous size, has the mind of a young child. Yet they have formed a ""family,"" clinging together in the face of loneliness and alienation. Laborers in California's dusty vegetable fields, they hustle work when they can, living a hand-to-mouth existence. But George and Lennie have a plan: to own an acre of land and a shack they can call their own.While the powerlessness of the laboring class is a recurring theme in Steinbeck's work of the late 1930s, he narrowed his focus when composing 'Of Mice and Men' (1937), creating an intimate portrait of two men facing a world marked by petty tyranny, misunderstanding, jealousy, and callousness. But though the scope is narrow, the theme is universal: a friendship and a shared dream that makes an individual's existence meaningful.A unique perspective on life's hardships, this story has achieved the status of timeless classic due to its remarkable success as a novel, a Broadway play, and three acclaimed films.",Classics,Fiction,School,got look me got look you that swhy unlikely pair george small quick dark face lennie man tremendous size mind young child yet formed family clinging together face loneliness alienation laborers california s dusty vegetable fields hustle work can living hand to mouth existence george lennie plan acre land shack call own while powerlessness laboring class recurring theme steinbeck s work late 1930s narrowed focus composing of mice men 1937 creating intimate portrait two men facing world marked petty tyranny misunderstanding jealousy callousness though scope narrow theme universal friendship shared dream makes individual s existence meaningful a unique perspective life s hardships story achieved status timeless classic due remarkable success novel broadway play three acclaimed films
